## Prerequisite

* Make sure your python version is between 3.8 to 3.11 (to prevent any dependency issues)

* (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    * `python3 -m venv .myenv`
    * `source ./.myenv/bin/activate`

* Install the libraries using pip: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Test translations using the saved model

simply run : `python3 run_saved_model.py`

It opens up a prompt to let you select the model (English to Konkani or Konkani to English) or specify the path to the model. On successful loading of the model, you can enter an input and it returns the translated output.

## Evaluation: Bleu Score

* English to Konkani:
    * model codename: T_BASE_EK_07_07
    * Bleu-4 score: **_29.03%_**

* Konkani to English:
    * model codename: T_BASE_KE_17_07
    * Bleu-4 score: **_23.20%_**


## Building vocabulary

* **This requires you to have a dataset!** The code uses BERT tokenizer (Word-Piece tokenizer) to generated the vocabulary. Note that this is a very CPU/GPU intensive task and thus can take a lot of time depending on your system performance.

* run : `python3 building_vocabulary.py`

* specify the path of your dataset and the max size of the vocabulary

* Generates the vocabulary adding `.vocab` extention to file name of the dataset


## Training model from scratch

* Prerequisites:
    * A parallel corpus in two separate files
    * Two separate vocabulary files for source and target languages

* Modify the configuration file `config.env` to set the dataset paths, vocabulary, epochs and architecture (leave it to default if you want to use the BASE configurations)

* train the model: `python3 transformer_train.py config.env`


## Using Pretrained weights

* open config.env file and modify the variables to specify your dataset file and model name/path (Example shown below):
```
# -----Configurations of the Transformer model----- #

# Model name
MODEL_NAME=TRANS_BASE_EK

## Path to training data of source language
CONTEXT_DATA_PATH=dataset/FULL_DATA.en

## Path to training data of target language
TARGET_DATA_PATH=dataset/FULL_DATA.gom

## Path to vocabulary of source language
CONTEXT_TOKEN_PATH=vocabulary/bert_en.vocab

## Path to vocabulary data of target language
TARGET_TOKEN_PATH=vocabulary/bert_gom.vocab

# Reloading weights from pretrained model (Comment out or leave empty or set to 'None' if not using)
WEIGHTS_PATH=trained_models/T_BASE_EK_07_07/checkpoints/best_model.weights.hdf5
```

* Make sure that architecture variables like `NUM_LAYERS`,`DFF`, etc match the architecture of the pretrained model weights (specified in `config.env` inside the `checkpoints` directory)

* Set the epochs using the `epochs` variable 

* To start training run: `python3 transformer_train.py config.env`
